# LES Study Analysis
Python code to analyze data from user studies conducted using [LES](https://github.com/NUDelta/low-effort-sensing).

## Setup and Use
### Installation
We use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for managing package dependencies.

1. Install pipenv using the link above.
2. Run `pipenv install` to install package dependencies and `pipenv shell` to start virtual environment with installed dependencies.
3. To use the Jupyter Google Maps plugin, run `jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix gmaps` once you are in the virtual envrionment.

### Running and Modifying Code
All analysis is done in Jupyter notebooks. To start the notebook server, run `jupyter notebook` and open your web browser. Use the in-browswer UI to select and open the desired notebook.
